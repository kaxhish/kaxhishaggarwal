    <h2>Organic Chemisry--</h2>
<p> Nowdays i am stying Organic Chemistry and its actually blown my mind dramastically. 
    people think that organic Chemistry is tough and it is the stressful part of Chemistry  and some of the people don't suggest
     medical because of organic Chemistry sometimes and it is also thinked that it is in combination with mathematics and guys who 
     are no more in mathematics afraid of it a lot but intrusting fact is that...  <br>
    <br> </p>
    
    <h1>.Carbon and its compound-</h1>
    <p>Basically carbon is of versatile nature. it is spread all around us. Everything is made up of carbon. If 
        you have noticed when you burn something like a paper , a gas evolves which actually is carbon mean the paper is made up of 
        carbon because carbon evolved . Don't you think that carbon is really a amazing substance because from the whole 118 elements 
        it is the only which has given a special culture "organic". when you read aabout it you see that carbon has covalent bond. 
    </p>

    <h1>.Covalent Bonds-</h1>
    <p>As we see in the last paragraph carbon has covalent bond and it always share its electron as you know very well that
        covalent bonding means sharing of electrons from the valence shell (valence shell means--last shell of an element like k,l, m,n shells)
        carbon's valence shell is l and it has 4 electrons in its valence shell as you know to fullful the octate rule there must 
        be 8 carbon atoms in the valence shell of any atom .so, to fullfil this condition carbon shares it electrons with other elements like hydogen
        and others.. the most famous is hydrogen and these are called hydrocarbons.
