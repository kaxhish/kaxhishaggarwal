<p class="text-black m-10 text-xl lowercase tracking-widest"> Nowdays i am stying Organic Chemistry and its actually blown my mind dramastically. 
    people think that organic Chemistry is tough and it is the stressful part of Chemistry  and some of the people don't suggest
     medical because of organic Chemistry sometimes and it is also thinked that it is in combination with mathematics and guys who 
     are no more in mathematics afraid of it a lot but intrusting fact is that...  <br>

        In the education sector of biotech ,you can also do things like graduation.if you are  from a medical <br>
         or engineering sector 
        you can apply for biotechThe technological advancements have resulted , <br> in (1) many biopharmaceuticals and vaccines,
         (2) new and specific ways to diagnose, (3) increasing the productivity <br> and introduction of quality traits in
          agricultural crops, (4) the ways to tackle the pollutants efficiently for sustainable <br> environmental practices,
           (5) helped the forensic experts by DNA fingerprinting and profiling, (6) fermentation <br>
            technology for production 
           of industrially important products.

<h1 class="text-black text-3xl m-10 font-bold capitalize">medical biotecnology</h1>
<p class="text-black text-xl normalcase tracking-widest ml-16 mb-10">This field of biotechnology has many applications and is involved in production of <br>
     recombinant pharmaceuticals, tissue engineering products, regenerative medicines , <br>
     such as stem cell and gene therapy, and many more biotechnology products for better human life <br>
      Biotechnological tools produce purified bio-therapeutic agents on industrial scales. <br>
       These include both novel agents and agents formerly available only in small quantities. <br>
        Crude vaccines were used in antiquity in China, India, and Persia. For example, <br>
         vaccination with scabs that contained the smallpox virus was a practice in the East for centuries. </p>

            Some biotechapproaches to better health have proven to be more challenging than others. An example is gene transfer, <br>
             where the defective gene is replaced with a normally functioning one. The normal gene is delivered to target tissues <br>
              in most cases by virus that is genetically altered to render it harmless. The first ex vivo gene transfer experiment, <br>
               conducted in 1990 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on Ashanti DeSilva who was suffering from severe combined <br> 
                immunodeficiency (SCID) helped boost her immune response and successfully corrected an enzyme deficiency.
