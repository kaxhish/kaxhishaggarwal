        <p>Beyound the imagination of Medicals and all these science biology ,there is really
            a amazing Healing thing called Acupressure . i just started reading it because it am a lot intrusted in creative bioStudies 
            , Yogic practices and meditaions. From my thinking of perception Everyone should know and learn about acupressure techquinics 
            because there is no degree and you can  learn its basics in just 2-3 months from any of training center....</p>

        <h1>.About Healing points-</h1>

            heal a person. Acupoints can heal every disease because there are speacific point for every disease but for that you have a 
            need of good reflexologist and the thing is that by learning some of healing points you can caure some day to day non-chronic diseaseas.
