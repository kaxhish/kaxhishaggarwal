        <p class="text-black m-10 text-xl lowercase tracking-widest">Beyound the imagination of Medicals and all these science biology ,there is really
            a amazing Healing thing called Acupressure . i just started reading it because it am a lot intrusted in creative bioStudies 
            , Yogic practices and meditaions. From my thinking of perception Everyone should know and learn about acupressure techquinics 
            because there is no degree and you can  learn its basics in just 2-3 months from any of training center....</p>

               <p class="text-black m-10 text-xl lowercase tracking-widest">
                When we say "yoga", for many of you it probably means some impossible physical postures. That is not what we <br>
                 are referring to here. Yoga simply means to be in perfect tune. When you are in yoga, your body, mind and energy <br>
                  and existence are in absolute harmony. When your body and mind are in a relaxed state and at a certain level of <br>
                   blissfulness, you can be free of so many nagging ailments. <br>
                    Let us say, you go and sit in your office with a naggin headache. Your headache is not a major disease, but <br>
                     just that throbbing could take away some of your enthusiasm for  work and perhaps some of your capability  <br>
                      for that day. But with the practice of yoga, your body and mind can be kept at the highest possible peak.
